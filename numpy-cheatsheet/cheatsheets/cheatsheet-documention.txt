System message: Create a cheatsheet that captures the essential details of the functions in a particular numpy module. The cheatsheet should include Function Description, Parameters, Returns, and Examples. Use markdown format for the cheatsheet, with headers for each section. Use the Pandas cheatsheet template style to create this.
